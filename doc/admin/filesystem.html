  <h1>PkgForge Admin - Filesystem Configuration</h1>

<p>
One of the most important aspects of the design of the Package Forge
system is the filesystem used to store all the data associated with
build jobs at the various stages in their lifecycle. Basically this
breaks down into three sections:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>incoming</dt>
  <dd>This is the directory into which new jobs are submitted. All
  users of the system must be able to create new sub-directories
  within this directory. The incoming queue processor must be able to
  read this directory and also be able to delete anything within the
  directory.</dd>

  <dt>accepted</dt>
  <dd>This is the directory into which valid jobs are transferred once
  they have been accepted by the incoming queue processor. Therefore
  the incoming queue processor must be able to create sub-directories
  within this directory. The build daemons and web interface must be
  able to read all the contents of this directory, the users may wish
  to also be able to read the contents but it is not essential.  For
  sanity all users should be prevented from creating or deleting files
  or directories within this directory (that includes the build
  daemons and web interface).</dd>

  <dt>results</dt>
  <dd>This is the directory into which the results of build jobs
  (e.g. packages and log files) are stored. The build daemons must be
  able to create sub-directories within this directory. The web
  interface must have read access for this directory, the users may
  wish to also be able to read the contents but it is not
  essential. For sanity all users should be prevented from creating or
  deleting files or directories within this directory (that includes
  the incoming queue processor and web interface).</dd>

</dl>

<p>These requirements can be converted into a number of different
methods of running the system. It could be that each sub-system
(incoming processor, build daemons and web interface) runs as a
different Unix user with permissions being managed by the traditional
Unix model. In the School of Informatics we use OpenAFS so the ACLs
were done using that system and they are described below.</p>

<p>
Some form of networked filesystem is required for the build daemons to
be able to access the input files in the <em>accepted</em> jobs
directory and store back files into the <em>results</em>
directory. NFS should work but has not been tested.
</p>

<h2>Using AFS</h2>

<p>When using AFS it probably makes most sense to have all the
pkgforge directories within a single AFS volume. This makes it easy to
move around and make backups. A volume can be created like this:</p>

<pre>
% vos create -server host1.example.org -partition /vicepd -name pkgforge -maxquota 100000000
% fs mkmount -dir /afs/example.org/pkgs/pkgforge -vol pkgforge -rw
</pre>

<p>This would be done as an AFS super-user. Note that the maximum
quota has been deliberately set to something fairly large, the default
limit is fairly small and will be reached quite quickly.</p>

<p>Once this has been done the sub-directories can be created:</p>

<pre>
% mkdir -p /afs/example.org/pkgs/pkgforge
% mkdir -p /afs/example.org/pkgs/pkgforge/incoming
% mkdir -p /afs/example.org/pkgs/pkgforge/accepted
% mkdir -p /afs/example.org/pkgs/pkgforge/results
</pre>

<h3>Users and Groups</h3>

<p>The different sub-systems each run as the same Unix user but as a
different AFS user. We currently have the following AFS users:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pkgforge_incoming.ardbeg.inf.ed.ac.uk</li>
  <li>pkgforge_web.ardbeg.inf.ed.ac.uk</li>
  <li>pkgforge_builder.bigfan.inf.ed.ac.uk</li>
  <li>pkgforge_builder.elman.inf.ed.ac.uk</li>
  <li>pkgforge_builder.gates.inf.ed.ac.uk</li>
  <li>pkgforge_builder.bressler.inf.ed.ac.uk</li>
</ul>

<p>Rather than managing the ACLs on the various directories by adding
and deleting individual users, which is likely to result in errors and
oversights, AFS groups are used. This means that the ACLs on the
directories should never need to be altered. There are normally three
groups:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pkgforge_incoming</li>
  <li>pkgforge_web</li>
  <li>pkgforge_builder</li>
</ul>

<p>The purpose of each group should be fairly obvious. Normally
the <code>pkgforge_incoming</code> and <code>pkgforge_web</code> AFS
groups would each only contain a single AFS user but there are no
limits. This is useful when moving services from one host to another
and they both need access during a transition period.</p>

<p>Full details on managing AFS users and groups can be found
elsewhere but here is an example of the basics:</p>

<pre>
% pts creategroup pkgforge_builder

% pts createuser -name pkgforge_builder.host1.example.org -id 28251
% pts adduser -user pkgforge_builder.host1.example.org -group pkgforge_builder
</pre>

<p>If you do not already have an appropriate AFS group you may wish to
create another AFS group (e.g. <code>pkgforge_users</code>) which
would include all users of the pkgforge system.</p>

<p>Note that the createuser commands must be done as the AFS
super-user but all the group management can be done as a normal AFS
user.</p>

<h3>ACLs</h3>

<p>The previous description of requirements is translated into a set
of AFS ACLs which can now be applied to the previously created
directories with the various groups. Note that to gain access (for
either read or write) all the users must be able to at least list the
higher-level directories in the tree. Note also that to ensure only
the required ACLs are set on each directory the <code>-clear</code>
option is being used throughout.</p>

<pre>
% fs setacl -clear -dir /afs/example.org/pkgs/pkgforge -acl\
                 system:administrators rlidwka\
                 pkgforge_incoming     read\
                 pkgforge_builder      read\
                 pkgforge_web          read\
                 pkgforge_users        read\
                 system:authuser       read

% fs setacl -clear -dir /afs/example.org/pkgs/pkgforge/incoming -acl\
                 system:administrators rlidwka\
                 pkgforge_incoming     write\
                 pkgforge_users        rli\
                 system:authuser       read

% fs setacl -clear -dir /afs/example.org/pkgs/pkgforge/accepted -acl\
                 system:administrators rlidwka\
                 pkgforge_incoming     write\
                 pkgforge_builder      read\
                 pkgforge_web          read\
                 pkgforge_users        read\
                 system:authuser       read

fs setacl -clear -dir /afs/example.org/pkgs/pkgforge/results -acl\
                 system:administrators rlidwka\
                 pkgforge_incoming     write\
                 pkgforge_builder      write\
                 pkgforge_web          read\
                 pkgforge_users        read\
                 system:authuser       read
</pre>

<p>It is assumed that the <code>/afs/example.org/pkgs</code> directory
already existed and was accessible by the users.</p>

<p>Most of the ACLs are fairly self-explanatory but note that for the
incoming directory the users only have read, lookup and insert rights,
they do not have any ability to delete entries or write into files
they do not own (normal <em>write</em> access translates
into <em>rlidwk</em>) see the DROPBOXES section of the fs_setacl(1)
manual page for more details.</p>

<p>Note also that we have added permissions for all authenticated
users to be able to read the contents. Depending on what you are
building on the pkgforge system you may wish to remove that
access.</p>
